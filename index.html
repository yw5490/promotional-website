    <p class="center">In 'Squid Game,' viewers are immersed in a high-stakes world of financial despair as the story unfolds around Gi-hun, a struggling South Korean man. He, along with other desperate individuals, is invited to participate in a series of deadly childhood games on a secluded island. Promised immense wealth for the victor, they soon realize that these seemingly innocent games come with lethal consequences. 'Squid Game' explores themes of inequality and the human spirit in a relentless battle for survival, where alliances form, trust erodes, and the true cost of winning becomes hauntingly apparent.</p>
